Problem:
    I wasn't sure why it was giving me an error when I attempted to make my buttons into an array
    so I looked up the syntax to see what I was doing wrong and why my buttons wouldn't respond.
Resource Used:
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15642104/array-of-buttons-in-android
    I typed in "how to make array of buttons android"
Solution:
    I found that when using buttons in the array that was fine but I needed to use the findByViewId
    method in order to locate the actual button in the GUI so i added that in and it worked fine after that

Problem:
    Before switching back to buttons (I had first started with buttons and then imageViews/bitMaps and then back
    to buttons) I had to look up how to use a surface view and how to use bitMaps.
Resource Used:
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4255859/touch-and-drag-image-in-android
    I searched "dragging imageView android"
Solution:
    I ended up attempting to follow the code given but implement it so it would work with what I wanted and although
    I got the imageViews to appear on the GUI I could not figure out the dragging aspect so I switched back to buttons

Problem:
    After switching everything back to buttons and implementing my grpahics and sizes I wanted I created a method onto which depending on
    the number you clicked it would switch them based on location. I although was having trouble having them randomly appear.

Solution:
    After talking to her about it in class she offered to help me and we went over how to 1, change my code (where the locations were switched)
    to be a little more efficient and less clunky. After than it was easy for us to come up with a method to randomize all the buttons when the
    reset button was pressed but at the same time keeping the puzzle solvable adding one of the enhancements.

Problem:
    I could not figure out why I was having trouble calling the random method in my onCreate when it seemed that it should have been working
Resource Used:
    Professor Vegdhal's office hours
Solution:
    we were able to come up with a solution in order to instead of moving the actual button when clicking we made it so that only the text would move
    this then allowed us to call the random method in the onCreate and it worked fine.

Problem:
    Help finalizing the method in which the games knows whether or not a button is in the correct spot
Resource Used:
    Rachel Plaisted
Solution:
    all I needed to do was fix my for loop a little to better match the array of buttons I had also forgotten to call them in my onCreate and move
    methods.
